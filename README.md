# Overview

Hangman Game!

A kid's game in which the player is asked to guess letter by letter a random word, and has a limited amount of guesses. If he doesn't guess, then he's hanged (represented by a drawing and not hanging the guy for real).

This version is written in Java and runs on the terminal. For each mistake, more parts will be added to the drawing, until you die or you succeed guessing the word.

I chose to write this game, so I can have a basic interaction with Java. I didn't know anything about the language before, but now I feel that I have a basic notion of its syntax. Of course, I'll continue to learn of it so I can feel more comfortable approaching problems with it.

# Development Environment

- Visual Studio Code
- Extension Pack for Java: This is a bundle of extensions to write Java in VS Code
- java.io: Package I used for handling a file not found exception and loading the words
- java.util: Package I used for using datastructures, allow user input, and generate a random number

# Future Work

* Add a log with the words that have been guessed and not guessed
* Use better graphics instead of only keyboard characters
* Add a two-player version
